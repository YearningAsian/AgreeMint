# AgreeMint - Problem Statement (Draft)

## Executive Summary

AgreeMint is an AI-powered contract analysis and verification tool designed to democratize legal contract review by providing automated, intelligent analysis of contractual agreements. The tool aims to reduce the time, cost, and complexity associated with contract review while improving accuracy and consistency in identifying potential issues, risks, and opportunities within legal documents.

## Problem Definition

### Current Challenges in Contract Management

1. **High Cost and Time Investment**: Traditional contract review requires expensive legal expertise and significant time investment, making comprehensive contract analysis inaccessible to small businesses and individuals.

2. **Human Error and Inconsistency**: Manual contract review is prone to human error, fatigue, and inconsistent interpretation, especially for lengthy or complex agreements.

3. **Limited Accessibility**: Small businesses, startups, and individuals often lack access to qualified legal professionals for contract review, leading to acceptance of potentially unfavorable terms.

4. **Scalability Issues**: Organizations dealing with high volumes of contracts struggle to maintain consistent review quality while meeting business timeline requirements.

5. **Knowledge Gaps**: Non-legal professionals lack the expertise to identify subtle but important contractual risks, obligations, and opportunities.
